## What is Tabario?

**Tabario** is an AI-powered video creation platform designed to help individuals, creators, and marketing agencies quickly generate high-quality videos for social media.\
No need for editing skills or production teams — just describe your idea, and let Tabario handle the rest.

---

## How It Works

### 1. Generate Your Idea

Start by prompting the AI with a short description of the video you want to create.\
You can also specify the **language** for your video:

- Brazilian Portuguese
- English (US)

Tabario will then generate a complete **video idea and script** based on your description.

---

### 2. Refine Your Script

Once your idea is ready, you can:

- Edit the current idea manually
- Generate variations of the video script
- Change the tone of voice (for example, from professional to funny, or serious to casual)

This gives you full creative control before producing the video.

### 3. Generate the Video

After finalizing your idea, it’s time to bring it to life.

Choose from several customization options:

- **Art Style:**
  - Cinematic
  - Crayon Drawings
  - Anime
- **Voiceover Selection:**\
  Pick from different AI voices.\
  _(The subtitles language will automatically match the chosen voice.)_

Then click **Generate Video**, and Tabario will handle the rest.

_Video generation typically takes between 10–30 minutes, depending on script length._\
_(Currently supports videos up to 60 seconds.)_
