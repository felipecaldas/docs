# Generate a Video Idea

The **Generate Video Idea** feature is where your creative process begins in Tabario.  
Here, you describe what your video should be about — and Tabario’s AI transforms that prompt into a complete video concept and script.

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Generate Idea screen">
    From your Tabario dashboard, click **“Generate Video Idea.”**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Describe your idea">
    Enter a short description of your desired video. Be specific enough for the AI to understand your intent but concise enough to keep the video focused.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Specify the language">
    Tabario currently supports two languages:
    - **English (US)**
    - **Brazilian Portuguese (PT-BR)**
    <br/>
    Be sure to mention your language preference in the prompt.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate your idea">
    Click **“Generate”** and Tabario will create a unique concept and draft script based on your input.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Writing a Great Prompt

Crafting a clear, focused prompt helps the AI generate better results.  
Follow these best practices:

<Card title="Do’s" icon="circle-check">
- Keep your idea focused on **one or two key topics**.  
- Mention the **tone or style** (e.g., funny, inspirational, educational).  
- Include your **target audience** if relevant.  
- Specify the **language** — English or PT-BR.
</Card>

<Card title="Don’ts" icon="circle-xmark">
- Avoid including **too many themes or ideas** in one prompt.  
- Don’t use vague requests like “make it good” or “add something viral.”  
- Avoid listing more than **two main products, services, or goals** in one prompt.

## Example Prompts

Here are a few good examples to inspire you:

<Card title="Example 1: English">
Create a 30-second social media video about a **new fitness app** that helps users stay consistent with daily workouts. The tone should be **motivational** and **upbeat**. Language: **English**.
</Card>

<Card title="Example 2: Portuguese">
Crie um vídeo curto de **30 segundos** para redes sociais apresentando um **novo café artesanal brasileiro**. O tom deve ser **divertido** e **acolhedor**. Idioma: **Português (PT-BR)**.
</Card>

## Recommended Length and Focus

<Tip>
Keep your description between **1–3 sentences**.  
Focus on **a single topic or theme** for the most effective AI generation results.
